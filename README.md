Intro to DH
Overview: What is “data” in the humanities, and how can we work with it? What are some of the advantages and limitations of digital humanities approaches? This week-long workshop offers an introduction to the field of digital humanities, broadly considered. We will begin with an overview of the field and a general discussion of data in the humanities, looking at different ways to collect, clean, and visualize it. The remaining days of the workshop series will consist of deep dives into specific areas of digital humanities research, including text mining, network analysis, and spatial analysis. Throughout, we will move between aggregate, distant readings of texts and traditional close readings to consider what is gained and lost in the transition. We will conclude the week by discussing options for sharing your work online.  Digital humanities is an expansive, rapidly evolving area of research. This workshop is designed to give you a foundation, introducing you to approaches and resources you can continue with beyond the workshop. Over the week, you will gain hands-on experience working with popular open source tools used by digital humanities practitioners. You will also learn best practices for developing your own digital humanities projects, from how to curate a dataset and identify a tool or approach that is suited to your research question to creating effective and compelling data visualizations you can share.
